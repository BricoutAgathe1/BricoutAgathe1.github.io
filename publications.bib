   abstract = {Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) relies on the back-to-back γ-rays generated through a positron annihilation to track a single radiolabelled particle in three dimensions and in dense, multiphase, and opaque systems. The spectrum of applications of PEPT such as batch mixing systems in chemical, food and pharmaceutical sectors or granulation, die-filling and fluidisation in industrial processes, is directly related to the development of efficient radiolabelled materials and often restricted due to the lack of suitable materials with adequate radiochemical properties. In this work, we report a straightforward synthesis and radiolabelling of calcium alginate beads of different size, specific surface, concentration, and density, with the positron emitter gallium-68 (68Ga) to cover a broad range of possibilities in PEPT. We demonstrate a high intrinsic affinity between alginate and 68Ga providing directly radiolabelled particles with excellent radiochemical properties and excellent performance for tracking complex trajectories. These results, in combination with the availability and relatively simple chemistry of 68Ga, provide a high versatile and straightforward platform for the future development and advance of PEPT in different applications.},

   abstract = {Background/Aims. Ultrasound is the second most utilised medical imaging modality in England(NHS England, 2023), thanks to its non-invasive and non-ionising nature, affordability, and portability(Carovac et al., 2011). Quality assurance (QA) of ultrasound systems relies on test objects, often composed of tissue-mimicking materials (TMM)(Dudley et al., 2014). The Edinburgh Pipe Phantom (EPP)(Pye & Ellis, 2002) is a test-object made from the IEC agar-based TMM (IEC, 2001), for assessing imaging performance. Innovations in its design, such as incorporating polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) cryogel pipes, require further exploration to easily vary the acoustic properties within the pipes. Although the effects of freezing on agar's structural properties are well documented(Dalvi-Isfahan et al., 2017), the impact on its acoustic properties remain uncharacterised, limiting the integration of freeze-thaw cycles into multi-material phantoms. This study aimed to acoustically characterise the IEC agar-based TMM subjected to up to three freeze-thaw cycles, assessing its suitability for constructing EPPs with PVA cryogel pipes. Methods. IEC agar-based TMM samples were fabricated using a standardised recipe and preserved in a water-glycerol-benzalkonium chloride solution. Samples underwent 0-3 freeze-thaw cycles, each comprising 12 hours at-18°C followed by controlled thawing. Acoustic properties, including speed of sound, and acoustic attenuation were measured using through-transmission substitution methods over the 3.5-50MHz frequency range, whilst the relative backscatter power was measured using the substitution method(International Electrotechnical Commission, 2019). Microscopic analysis was conducted to observe structural changes. Results. No significant variations in speed of sound, acoustic attenuation, or relative backscatter power were observed across freeze-thaw cycles, over the 3.5-50MHz frequency range. Acoustic attenuation averaged 0.57 ± 0.13 dB.cm-1 .MHz-1 and the speed of sound was found to be 1536.72 ± 43.14 m.s-1 , both remaining consistent regardless of freeze-thaw treatment. Microscopic analysis revealed structural changes, such as micro-cracks, but these did not impact acoustic properties-however their impact on imaging remains to be assessed. Discussion/Conclusion. The findings demonstrate that IEC agar-based TMM maintains stable acoustic properties despite freeze-thaw-induced structural changes. These results support its use in developing advanced phantoms, such as the EPP with PVA cryogel pipes, broadening the scope of QA and training applications in ultrasound imaging. Further work is required to optimise the incorporation of PVA cryogel within EPPs.},
