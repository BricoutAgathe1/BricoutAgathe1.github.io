abstract: Positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) relies on the back-to-back Î³-rays
  generated through a positron annihilation to track a single radiolabelled particle
  in three dimensions and in dense, multiphase, and opaque systems. The spectrum of
  applications of PEPT such as batch mixing systems in chemical, food and pharmaceutical
  sectors or granulation, die-filling and fluidisation in industrial processes, is
  directly related to the development of efficient radiolabelled materials and often
  restricted due to the lack of suitable materials with adequate radiochemical properties.
  In this work, we report a straightforward synthesis and radiolabelling of calcium
  alginate beads of different size, specific surface, concentration, and density,
  with the positron emitter gallium-68 (68Ga) to cover a broad range of possibilities
  in PEPT. We demonstrate a high intrinsic affinity between alginate and 68Ga providing
  directly radiolabelled particles with excellent radiochemical properties and excellent
  performance for tracking complex trajectories. These results, in combination with
  the availability and relatively simple chemistry of 68Ga, provide a high versatile
  and straightforward platform for the future development and advance of PEPT in different
  applications.
